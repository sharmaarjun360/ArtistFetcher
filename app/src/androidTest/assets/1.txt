"description":"#1 New York Times Bestseller<br /><br />Over&#xa0;2 million copies sold<br /><br />In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be \"positive\" all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people.<br /><br />For decades, we’ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. \"F**k positivity,\" Mark Manson says. \"Let’s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it.\" In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn’t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling, let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected&#xa0;modern society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up. <br /><br />Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited—\"not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault.\" Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek. <br /><br />There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives."},

"description":"<b>A riveting, deeply personal account of history in the making—from the president who inspired us to believe in the power of democracy<\/b><br />&#xa0;<br />In the stirring, highly anticipated first volume of his presidential memoirs, Barack Obama tells the story of his improbable odyssey from young man searching for his identity to leader of the free world, describing in strikingly personal detail both his political education and the landmark moments of the first term of his historic presidency—a time of dramatic transformation and turmoil.<br /><br />Obama takes readers on a compelling journey from his earliest political aspirations to the pivotal Iowa caucus victory that demonstrated the power of grassroots activism to the watershed night of November 4, 2008, when he was elected 44th president of the United States, becoming the first African American to hold the nation’s highest office.<br /><br />Reflecting on the presidency, he offers a unique and thoughtful exploration of both the awesome reach and the limits of presidential power, as well as singular insights into the dynamics of U.S. partisan politics and international diplomacy. Obama brings readers inside the Oval Office and the White House Situation Room, and to Moscow, Cairo, Beijing, and points beyond. We are privy to his thoughts as he assembles his cabinet, wrestles with a global financial crisis, takes the measure of Vladimir Putin, overcomes seemingly insurmountable odds to secure passage of the Affordable Care Act, clashes with generals about U.S. strategy in Afghanistan, tackles Wall Street reform, responds to the devastating <i>Deepwater Horizon<\/i> blowout, and authorizes Operation Neptune’s Spear, which leads to the death of Osama bin Laden.<br /><br /><i>A Promised Land<\/i> is extraordinarily intimate and introspective—the story of one man’s bet with history, the faith of a community organizer tested on the world stage. Obama is candid about the balancing act of running for office as a Black American, bearing the expectations of a generation buoyed by messages of “hope and change,” and meeting the moral challenges of high-stakes decision-making. He is frank about the forces that opposed him at home and abroad, open about how living in the White House affected his wife and daughters, and unafraid to reveal self-doubt and disappointment. Yet he never wavers from his belief that inside the great, ongoing American experiment, progress is always possible.<br /><br />This beautifully written and powerful book captures Barack Obama’s conviction that democracy is not a gift from on high but something founded on empathy and common understanding and built together, day by day."},

It’s a must-read.”—<i>Parade<\/i><\/b><br /><br />Malibu: August 1983. It’s the day of Nina Riva’s annual end-of-summer party, and anticipation is at a fever pitch. Everyone wants to be around the famous Rivas: Nina, the talented surfer and supermodel; brothers Jay and Hud, one a championship surfer, the other a renowned photographer; and their adored baby sister, Kit. Together the siblings are a source of fascination in Malibu and the world over—especially as the offspring of the legendary singer Mick Riva.<br /><br />The only person not looking forward to the party of the year is Nina herself, who never wanted to be the center of attention, and who has also just been very publicly abandoned by her pro tennis player husband. Oh, and maybe Hud—because it is long past time for him to confess something to the brother from whom he’s been inseparable since birth.<br /><br />Jay, on the other hand, is counting the minutes until nightfall, when the girl he can’t stop thinking about promised she’ll be there.<br /><br />And Kit has a couple secrets of her own—including a guest she invited without consulting anyone.<br /><br />By midnight the party will be completely out of control. By morning, the Riva mansion will have gone up in flames.

"description":"In The Bomber Mafia: A Dream, a Temptation, and the Longest Night of the Second World War, Malcolm Gladwell, author of New York Times bestsellers including Talking to Strangers and host of the podcast Revisionist History, uses original interviews, archival footage and his trademark insight to weave together the stories of a Dutch genius and his homemade computer, a band of brothers in central Alabama, a British psychopath, and pyromaniacal chemists at Harvard. As listeners hear these stories unfurl, Gladwell examines one of the greatest moral challenges in modern American history.  <br />Most military thinkers in the years leading up to World War II saw the airplane as an afterthought. But a small band of idealistic strategists had a different view. This “Bomber Mafia” asked:  What if precision bombing could, just by taking out critical choke points — industrial or transportation hubs – cripple the enemy and make war far less lethal? <br />In Revisionist History, Gladwell re-examines moments from the past and asks whether we got it right the first time. In The Bomber Mafia, he employs all the production techniques that make Revisionist History so engaging, stepping back from the bombing of Tokyo, the deadliest night of the war, and asking, “Was it worth it?”  The attack was the brainchild of General Curtis LeMay, whose brutal pragmatism and scorched-earth tactics in Japan cost thousands of civilian lives but may have spared more by averting a planned US invasion.<br />Things might have gone differently had LeMay’s predecessor, General Haywood Hansell, remained in charge.  As a key member of the Bomber Mafia, Haywood’s theories of precision bombing had been foiled by bad weather, enemy jet fighters, and human error. When he and Curtis LeMay squared off for a leadership handover in the jungles of Guam, LeMay emerged victorious, leading to the darkest night of World War II.<br />The Bomber Mafia is a riveting tale of persistence, innovation, and the incalculable wages of war."},

Such is the stern motto of House Stark, the northernmost of the fiefdoms that owe allegiance to King Robert Baratheon in far-off King’s Landing. There Eddard Stark of Winterfell rules in Robert’s name. There his family dwells in peace and comfort: his proud wife, Catelyn; his sons Robb, Brandon, and Rickon; his daughters Sansa and Arya; and his bastard son, Jon Snow. Far to the north, behind the towering Wall, lie savage Wildings and worse—unnatural things relegated to myth during the centuries-long summer, but proving all too real and all too deadly in the turning of the season.<br />&#xa0;<br />Yet a more immediate threat lurks to the south, where Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King, has died under mysterious circumstances. Now Robert is riding north to Winterfell, bringing his queen, the lovely but cold Cersei, his son, the cruel, vainglorious Prince Joffrey, and the queen’s brothers Jaime and Tyrion of the powerful and wealthy House Lannister—the first a swordsman without equal, the second a dwarf whose stunted stature belies a brilliant mind.

Yet, as a species, humans have lost the ability to breathe correctly, with grave consequences. <br /><br />Journalist James Nestor travels the world to figure out what went wrong and how to fix it. The answers aren’t found in pulmonology labs, as we might expect, but in the muddy digs of ancient burial sites, secret Soviet facilities, New Jersey choir schools, and the smoggy streets of São Paulo. Nestor tracks down men and women exploring the hidden science behind ancient breathing practices like Pranayama, Sudarshan Kriya, and Tummo and teams up with pulmonary tinkerers to scientifically test long-held beliefs about how we breathe.<br /><br />Modern research is showing us that making even slight adjustments to the way we inhale and exhale can jump-start athletic performance; rejuvenate internal organs; halt snoring, asthma, and autoimmune disease; and even straighten scoliotic spines. None of this should be possible, and yet it is. <br /><br />Drawing on thousands of years of medical texts and recent cutting-edge studies in pulmonology, psychology, biochemistry, and human physiology, <i>Breath <\/i>turns the conventional wisdom of what we thought we knew about our most basic biological function on its head. You will never breathe the same again."},

His family was convinced he had chosen option three: instead of attending his college graduation ceremony, he headed to India to become a monk, to meditate every day for four to eight hours, and devote his life to helping others. After three years, one of his teachers told him that he would have more impact on the world if he left the monk’s path to share his experience and wisdom with others.

The killer left no clues. There were no witnesses, no one with a motive. But the police soon came to suspect Quincy Miller, a young black man who was once a client of Russo’s.&#xa0;<br /><br /> Quincy was tried, convicted, and sent to prison for life. For twenty-two years he languished in prison, maintaining his innocence. &#xa0;But no one was listening. &#xa0;He had no lawyer, no advocate on the outside. In desperation, he writes a letter to Guardian Ministries, a small nonprofit run by Cullen Post, a lawyer who is also an Episcopal minister.<br /><br /> Guardian accepts only a few innocence cases at a time. &#xa0;Cullen Post travels the country fighting wrongful convictions and taking on clients forgotten by the system. With&#xa0;Quincy Miller, though, he gets far more than he bargained for. Powerful, ruthless people murdered Keith Russo, and they do not want Quincy Miller exonerated.<br /><br /> They killed one lawyer twenty-two years ago, and they will kill another without a second thought."},

"description":"<i>The Power of Habit<\/i> by Charles Duhigg is a thorough examination of several case studies about how habit formation and habit change impact daily life. It details the experiences of individuals, corporations, and organizations to illustrate how habits are made and why, how they can be changed, how habits of all kinds are used in businesses to attract customers or manage employees, and the devastating results of a poorly managed habit. <br /><br />Several studies of individuals with unusual habits or habit changes explain the neurological mechanisms that form habits in the brain. The habit, stored in the basal ganglia for neural efficiency, is the result of a loop comprised of three parts. These parts are cues that trigger the habit loop, a routine to execute, and feedback, or a reward that tells the brain to remember the habit for the future. Habits can be changed by retaining the cue and reward. <br /><br />Key Takeaways:  \n \n The brain forms habits automatically to increase mental efficiency and stores the habits in the basal ganglia. Habit-forming requires a cue that triggers the habit, a routine activity, and a reward to reinforce the habit.  \n Advertisers use the craving for a reward in a habit loop to drive consumer use of their products. The cue drives the routine out of a desire for the reward.  \n Habit change is most successful when the cue and reward remain the same, but the routine changes. Another force behind successful habit change is belief in the ability to change the habit.  \n Certain keystone habits are so integral to everyday behavior that changing them simultaneously changes numerous other habits. Although changing one habit does not directly cause change in others, the small win of committing to a keystone habit change eases the process for changing others."},

"description":"<b>#1 <i>NEW YORK TIMES <\/i>BESTSELLER • <b>A memoir of leadership and success<\/b>: The executive chairman of Disney,&#xa0;<i>Time<\/i>’s 2019 businessperson of the year,&#xa0;shares the ideas and values he embraced <b>during his fifteen years as CEO while reinventing&#xa0;one of the&#xa0;world’s&#xa0;most beloved companies&#xa0;<\/b>and inspiring the people who bring the magic to life.<\/b> <br /><br /><b>NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY NPR<\/b><br /><br />Robert Iger became CEO of The Walt Disney Company in 2005, during a difficult time.&#xa0;Competition was more intense than ever and technology was changing faster than at any time in the company’s history.&#xa0;His vision came down to three clear ideas: Recommit to the concept that quality matters, embrace technology instead of fighting it, and think bigger—think global—and turn Disney into a stronger brand in international markets.    <br /><br />Today, Disney is the largest, most admired media company in the world, counting Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, and 21st Century Fox among its properties. Its value is nearly five times what it was when Iger took over, and he is recognized as one of the most innovative and successful CEOs of our era.<br /><br />In&#xa0;<i>The Ride of a Lifetime<\/i>, Robert Iger shares the lessons he learned while running Disney and leading its 220,000-plus employees, and he explores the principles that are necessary for true leadership, including:<br /><br />•&#xa0;<b>Optimism.<\/b>&#xa0;Even in the face of difficulty, an optimistic leader will find the path toward the best possible outcome and focus on that, rather than give in to pessimism and blaming.<br />•&#xa0;<b>Courage.<\/b>&#xa0;Leaders have to be willing to take risks and place big bets. Fear of failure destroys creativity.  <br />•&#xa0;<b>Decisiveness.<\/b>&#xa0;All decisions, no matter how difficult, can be made on a timely basis. Indecisiveness is both wasteful and destructive to morale.<br /> •&#xa0;<b>Fairness.<\/b>&#xa0;Treat people decently, with empathy, and be accessible to them.  <br /><br />This book is about the relentless curiosity that has driven Iger for forty-five years, since the day he started as the lowliest studio grunt at ABC. It’s also about thoughtfulness and respect, and a decency-over-dollars approach that has become the bedrock of every project and partnership Iger pursues, from a deep friendship with Steve Jobs in his final years to an abiding love of the&#xa0;<i>Star Wars<\/i>&#xa0;mythology.<br />&#xa0;<br />“The ideas in this book strike me as universal” Iger writes.&#xa0;“Not just to the aspiring CEOs of the world, but to anyone wanting to feel less fearful, more confidently <i>themselves,<\/i> as they navigate their professional and even personal lives.”"},

"description":"The <i>Text<\/i> is Book 1 of 4 (three books and one supplement) of the A Course in Miracles series. <i>A Course in Miracles<\/i>, also known as \"the Course\" or ACIM, was scribed by Dr. Helen Schucman. It is a self-study course that aims to assist listeners, readers, and students in achieving spiritual transformation. ACIM presents a purely non-dualistic philosophy of forgiveness and includes practical lessons and applications for the practice of forgiveness in one's daily life. <br /><br />As its title implies, <i>A Course in Miracles<\/i> is arranged throughout as a teaching device. It consists of three books: <i>Text, Workbook for Students,<\/i> and <i>Manual for Teachers.<\/i> The order in which students choose to use the books, and the ways in which they study them, depends on their particular needs and preferences. Two supplements to the Course: \"Psychotherapy: Purpose, Process, Practice\" and \"The Song of Prayer\", are also included as part of ACIM. <br /><br />The curriculum the Course presents is carefully conceived and is explained, step by step, at both the theoretical and practical levels. It emphasizes application rather than theory, and experience rather than theology. Although Christian in statement, the Course deals with universal spiritual themes. It emphasizes that it is but one version of the universal curriculum. There are many others, this one differing from them only in form. They all lead to God in the end. <br /><br />Book 1: <i>Text<\/i> is largely theoretical, and sets forth the concepts on which the Course's thought system is based. Its ideas contain the foundation for the lessons in Book 2, the <i>Workbook for Students.<\/i> Without the practical application the <i>Workbook<\/i> provides, the <i>Text<\/i> would remain largely a series of abstractions which would hardly suffice to bring about the thought reversal at which the Course aims. <br /><br />Book 2: <i>Workbook for Students<\/i> includes 365 lessons, one for each day of the year. It is not necessary, however, to do the lessons at that tempo, and one might want to remain with a particularly appealing lesson for more than one day. The practical nature of the <i>Workbook<\/i> is underscored by the introduction to its lessons, which emphasizes experience through application rather than a prior commitment to a spiritual goal. Some of the ideas the <i>Workbook<\/i> presents you will find hard to believe, and others may seem to be quite startling. This does not matter. You are merely asked to apply the ideas as you are directed to do. You are not asked to judge them at all. You are asked only to use them. It is their use that will give them meaning to you, and will show you that they are true. <br /><br />Book 3: <i>Manual for Teachers<\/i> is written in question and answer form, and provides answers to some of the more likely questions a student might ask. It also includes a clarification of a number of the terms the Course uses, explaining them within the theoretical framework of the <i>Text<\/i>. The Course makes no claim to finality, nor are the lessons in its <i>Workbook<\/i> intended to bring the student's learning to completion. At the end, the reader is left in the hands of his or her own Internal Teacher, Who will direct all subsequent learning as He sees fit. <br /> \n<br />Supplements to ACIM, \"Psychotherapy: Purpose, Process, Practice\" and \"The Song of Prayer\", were scribed by Dr. Helen Schucman, as was <i>A Course in Miracles<\/i>, and are extensions of its principles."},

"description":"<b><b><b><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES<\/i> BEST SELLER<\/b> •<\/b> John Grisham takes you to a different kind of court in his first basketball novel. Samuel “Sooley” Sooleymon is a raw, young talent with big hoop dreams—and even bigger challenges off the court.<\/b><br /><br /> <b>“Hard to put down ... the pages turn quickly ... building to a climax that won’t leave readers doubting whether this is a John Grisham novel.” —Associated Press<\/b><br /><\/b><br />In the summer of his seventeenth year, Sam­uel Sooleymon gets the chance of a lifetime: a trip to the United States with his South Sudanese teammates to play in a showcase basket­ball tournament. He has never been away from home, nor has he ever been on an airplane. The opportunity to be scouted by dozens of college coaches is a dream come true.<br /><br />Samuel is an amazing athlete, with speed, quick­ness, and an astonishing vertical leap. The rest of his game, though, needs work, and the American coaches are less than impressed.<br /><br />During the tournament, Samuel receives dev­astating news from home: A civil war is raging across South Sudan, and rebel troops have ran­sacked his village. His father is dead, his sister is missing, and his mother and two younger brothers are in a refugee camp.<br /><br />Samuel desperately wants to go home, but it’s just not possible. Partly out of sympathy, the coach of North Carolina Central offers him a scholar­ship. Samuel moves to Durham, enrolls in classes, joins the team, and prepares to sit out his freshman season. There is plenty of more mature talent and he isn’t immediately needed.<br /><br />But Samuel has something no other player has: a fierce determination to succeed so he can bring his family to America. He works tirelessly on his game, shooting baskets every morning at dawn by himself in the gym, and soon he’s dominating everyone in practice. With the Central team los­ing and suffering injury after injury, Sooley, as he is nicknamed, is called off the bench. And the legend begins.<br /><br />But how far can Sooley take his team? And will success allow him to save his family?<br /><br />Gripping and moving, <i>Sooley<\/i> showcases John Grisham’s unparalleled storytelling powers in a whole new light. This is Grisham at the top of his game."},

"description":"Bill Maher first came to national attention as the host of the hit Comedy Central and ABC-TV program \n<i>Politically Incorrect<\/i>, where he offered a combustible mixture of irreverence and acerbic humor that helped him to garner a loyal following, as well as a reputation for being a hilarious provocateur. \n<br />Now, his popular new HBO television show, <i>Real Time with Bill Maher<\/i>, has put him more front and center than ever. In particular, one of the show's segments entitled \"New Rules\" has struck a chord with viewers. It's within his rules that Maher takes serious aim, bringing all his incisiveness, wit, and his signature exasperation to bear on topics ranging from cell phones (\"I don't need my cell phone to take pictures or access the Internet. I just need to make a phone call. From everywhere! Not just the places it likes!\") to fast food (\"New Rule: No more McDonald's in hospitals. I'm not kidding!\") to the conservative agenda (\"Stop claiming it's an agenda. It's not an agenda. It's a random collection of laws that your corporate donors paid you to pass.\"), Maher brings these brilliantly conceived riffs to audio for the first time, along with some singularly Maher-ian \"editorials\", editorials nothing like the standard fare found on the pages of the local newspaper!"},

Poland and Czechoslovakia had already fallen, and the Dunkirk evacuation was just two weeks away. For the next twelve months, Hitler would wage a relentless bombing campaign, killing 45,000 Britons. It was up to Churchill to hold his country together and persuade President Franklin Roosevelt that Britain was a worthy ally—and willing to fight to the end.<br /><br /> In <i>The Splendid and the Vile<\/i>, Erik Larson shows, in cinematic detail, how Churchill taught the British people “the art of being fearless.” It is a story of political brinkmanship, but it’s also an intimate domestic drama, set against the backdrop of Churchill’s prime-ministerial country home, Chequers; his wartime retreat, Ditchley, where he and his entourage go when the moon is brightest and the bombing threat is highest; and of course 10 Downing Street in London. Drawing on diaries, original archival documents, and once-secret intelligence reports—some released only recently—Larson provides a new lens on London’s darkest year through the day-to-day experience of Churchill and his family: his wife, Clementine; their youngest daughter, Mary, who chafes against her parents’ wartime protectiveness; their son, Randolph, and his beautiful, unhappy wife, Pamela; Pamela’s illicit lover, a dashing American emissary; and the advisers in Churchill’s “Secret Circle,” to whom he turns in the hardest moments.<br />&#xa0;<br /><i>The Splendid and the Vile<\/i>&#xa0;takes readers out of today’s political dysfunction and back to a time of true leadership, when, in the face of unrelenting horror, Churchill’s eloquence, courage, and perseverance bound a country, and a family, together.<br /><br /><b>This audiobook includes a recording of Winston Churchill's 1941 Christmas Eve speech.<\/b>"},
